They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	3-3

Lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless .	4-4
There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .	4-4
The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .	4-4
It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .	4-4

A disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a ` bad ' police shooting .	4-4
Too much power , not enough puff .	3-3

Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .	3-3

A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .	4-4
Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .	3-3
